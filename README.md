# VAD_paper
Source code for a (hopefully) paper

The general idea is to extend of the VAD algorithm that I wrote for my graduate thesis adding a more robust validation. 

Because of that I put de code into a R package [rvad](https://github.com/paocorrales/rvad) (the original code was written in python and was more slower).

**Status**
-  Working on some exploratory analysis.
